A Home Assistant HACS integration for Kippy pet trackers.

Device trackers created by this integration are prefixed with `Kippy` and your pet's name (for example, `Kippy Tilly`).

## Installation

2. Restart Home Assistant.
3. Configure the integration via the Home Assistant UI.

This repository is a work in progress and provides only a basic skeleton for future development.
